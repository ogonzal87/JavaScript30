# Day Five - [Flex Panel Gallery](https://github.com/stpCollabr8nLstn/JavaScript30/tree/master/05%20-%20Flex%20Panel%20Gallery)

This was a great intro to utilizing flex. JavaScript was super minimal today so I didn't see room for any major additions. 
As a bonus I just signed up for the [What the Flexbox?!](https://flexbox.io/) class because I want to know more of the flex things!
